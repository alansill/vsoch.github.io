NeuroSynth is a database that maps functional activation coordinates to behavioral terms, based on the frequency of the term in the paper.  The Cognitive Atlas is an ontology of cognitive terms, specifically for neuroscience.  I wanted to filter my NeuroSynth maps to those that are “convincingly behavioral,” and so I wrote some R scripts to do that.

However, when I had the .Rda all saved up, I thought it would be easy (and fun!) to throw this into a quick web interface, and unite the two websites.  An hour and a half later – done!
