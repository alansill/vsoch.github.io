As soon as eyes close, and water hits face <br>
My internal sense of direction is catapult to space. <br>
Spinning and soapy, slick as mole rat, <br>
Some omniscient Mom God is shaking her head at that. <br>
I fall through the mist, about to crash hard, <br>
But am saved by the support bar, miraculously unscarred.<br>

How can it be, so close to third decade and three, <br>
but still in the shower I cannot see? <br>
Proud as a lark, as I wash under my toes <br>
Between big and pinky, and up to my nose. <br>

The water shuts off, the journey is done.<br>
One more day I've survived and won! <br>
But what will tomorrow bring, a soapy demise? <br>
Let's just be realistic, and hope for no soap in my eyes. <br>
