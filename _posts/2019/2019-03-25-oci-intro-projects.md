The skeleton of documentation <a href="https://opencontainers.github.io/org/" target="_blank">is ready</a>
if you want to read more about the OpenContainer Initiative projects, and how to contribute.
In this Part II of the Dinosaur OCI Series, I give a broad overview of OCI projects, including:

<ol class="custom-counter">
    <li>The Image Manifest</li>
    <li>The Distribution Specification</li>
    <li>The Runtime Specification and runc</li>
</ol>

If you want more proper descriptions and links, go straight to the
<a href="https://opencontainers.github.io/org/" target="_blank">written docs</a>.
If you want to have some fun and see a terrible video, we have that too!
