An important aspect of any community is knowing <a href="https://opencontainers.github.io/org/contributing" target="_blank">how to contribute</a>.
To support this documentation, I've finished Part III of the Dinosaur OCI Series, where I give
a rather cheesy answer to this question. Generally, to contribute you should:

<ol class="custom-counter">
    <li>Come up with an idea</li>
    <li>Discuss the Idea</li>
    <li>Get Support and Take Action</li>
    <li>Ask for Detailed Feedback</li>
    <li>Possibly do an Example Implementation</li>
    <li>Finish your Contribution!</li>
</ol>

If you want more proper descriptions and links, go straight to the
<a href="https://opencontainers.github.io/org/contributing" target="_blank">contribution documentation</a>.
If you want to eat your sandwich and watch a thing, you can do that too.
