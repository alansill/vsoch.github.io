Happy Easter, Chocolate, Passover, and all the special holidays this weekend!
As I woke up this morning and was gravely disappointed to not be 10 years old
and battling my older brother to find chocolate eggs, I decided that I could
still have fun anyway. How do programmer dinosaurs have fun? They make Easter Egg
containers, of course!

```bash
$ docker pull vanessa/easter-egg:2019
```

## The Easter Egg Container Challenge

Looking for chocolate<br>
You used to do<br>
But now you wake up<br>
and feel rather blue!<br>
Never fear, code maintainer<br>
I've created you an easter egg container!<br>

<hr>

This is a competition. I'm giving you a week (up until this coming Friday, midnight)
to find easter eggs in that container. Yes, the one I mentioned before the monster bunny... pull it now!

```bash
$ docker pull vanessa/easter-egg:2019
```

There are 21, to be exact. When you find the eggs, write them into a list, and send them to me (do this however
you like, that's part of the challenge).  You don't need to find all of them, that would be rather hard!
Whomever finds the most is the winner. And what does the winner get? A prize, of course! After
the competition ends, I'll write up the eggs, and post the Dockerfile.

That's all I'm giving you! Let the contest begin!
