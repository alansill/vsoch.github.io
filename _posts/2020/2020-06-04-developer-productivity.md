I was invited to the <a href="https://collegeville.github.io/CW20/" target="_blank">Collegeville Workshop</a>
three days ago (Monday) and am thrilled that the entire thing is virtual and remote this
year, because otherwise my introverted self that is allergic to traveling would
likely not have been able to attend. The topic this year is developer productivity, 
meaning for a white paper:

> Your text can address impediments, challenges, opportunities, research directions or potential solutions, or combinations of these aspects.

I really wanted to contribute. But what insight could I offer? I first thought
about more technical approaches - talking about tools and software that might help
the remote developer. That didn't seem like something that was really in my wheelhouse
to have expertise on. I also thought about different kinds of managerial advice that
might be given, namely how to foster collaboration with a remote team. I largely
interact with open source communities or independent projects and I certainly don't
manage anyone, so I couldn't offer insight there.

## Write about what you know

I decided to take an overly simple approach, give in to writing about "softer" things,
and importantly, write about what I know. This started as one document to detail
some good practices and challenges, but very quickly morphed into two when I realized
that I had much more to say. So, without further adieu, here you go!

I am testing out <a href="https://docdrop.org" target="_blank">docdrop.org</a> as a suggestion
from <a href="https://twitter.com/judell/status/1266744655153999872" target="_blank">Jon Udell</a>,
which means you can add comments or annotations on it via <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/" target="_blank">hypothes.is</a> (and I'll need to figure out how to see them!)
I have a feeling that some of my thinking is relevant far beyond research software engineering,
and I also have no idea if these ideas have any insights for others because they seem obvious
to me. However, in the tiny case that one person is inspired, I wanted to share. 
I don't have any intention for these documents other than sharing with you,
possibly to inspire, or to help you think about yourself and what you want the future 
to look like. Now, it might be time for you to consider, what are the features of your
happiness and productivity? And what do you want the future to look like?
