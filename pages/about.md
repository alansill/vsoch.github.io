<p style="padding-top:40px;">I am a <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/vanessa-sochat" target="_blank">Research Software Engineer</a> for <a href="https://srcc.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford Research Computing</a> and an active dinosaur in the open source community. I specialize in system engineering, infrastructure development, and data processing for computational analyses and workflows. I am the primary developer at Stanford for 
<a href="https://www.singularity-hub.org" target="_blank">Singularity Hub</a>, the open source <a href="https://expfactory.github.io/" target="_blank"> 
Experiment Factory</a>, <a href="https://vsoch.github.io/datasets" target="_blank"> Dinosaur Datasets</a>, 
<a href="https://vsoch.github.io/lessons" target="_blank"> Research Computing Lessons</a>, and the <a href="https://researchapps.github.io/helpme" target="_blank"> HelpMe</a>  and  <a href="https://vsoch.github.io/watchme" target="_blank"> WatchMe</a>command line clients</p>.

<p>Right now, I'm really excited about two open source projects that I'm leading centered around continuous integration, 
and data organization and specifications. They are the <a href="https://openbases.github.io/" target="_blank">OpenBases</a>,
 templates that use Github+CircleCI for easy, reproducible research, and <a href="https://openschemas.github.io/" target="_blank">OpenSchemas</a>, a set of tools to interact with and develop specifications for schema.org. I want
to make generation of reproducible things fun, and easy, and for data to be organization and beautifully searchable.
I hope that you might reach out to contribute!</p>


<p>With my robot team, I am also lead developer of <a href="https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry" target="_blank">Singularity Registry</a>, <a href="https://sci-f.github.io" target="_blank">the Scientific Filesystem</a>, and <a href="https://singularityhub.github.io/" target="_blank"> Container Tools</a>, all tooling optimized for deployment of container-based workflows and "science as a service" capabilities.</p>

<p>As a graduate student my work spanned computer science, medicine, and imaging. I was a proud member of the <a href="http://poldracklab.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Poldrack Lab</a> at Stanford. Our work spanned neuro-informatics, cognitive neuroscience, and reproducibility. I was introduced to the domain of neuroimaging as an RA in the <a href="http://www.haririlab.com" target="_blank">Laboratory of Neurogenetics</a> at Duke University working under Ahmad Hariri.</p>

<p style="line-height:26px">The qualities of experience that are most fulfilling to me are making things work, organizing and understanding new processes, and creating efficiency and beauty in design. I love learning, programming and debugging, and I have vision for how I want the future to be. I am adamant about pursuing the things that make me happy, today and now. A successful life means confidence in a future vision and happiness in the present.</p>

<p>While this is primarily a personal site, most of my life can be found on <a href="http://www.github.com/vsoch" target="_blank">[github]</a>, and a general list of work under <a href="/work">[portfolio]</a>. During graduate school I maintained a space for exploration of methods and dataÂ <a href="http://www.vbmis.com/learn" target="_blank">[1]</a>, as well as pre-graduate school documentation and work <a href="http://www.vsoch.com/wiki" target="_blank">[2]</a>. Contact information and is available upon request.</p>
